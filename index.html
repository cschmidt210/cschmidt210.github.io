            I am a Senior studying Agricultural Systems Managment
            at Purdue University with a minor in crop science.
            I work on my uncle's farm on the weekends and during
            summer break where we farm corn, soybeans, beef cattle, and hay.

        This was one of our projects this summer
        working on my uncles farm. We drove to Iowa
        to pick up this grain dryer.

        This summer I helped crop scout fields and met with
     Channel Seed customers. We talked about crop growth and the 
     application of fungicide.

        I traveled to Visalia, California with my teammates to compete
        in the National Dairy Challenge competition. We traveled to a local dairy
        farm and evaluated their performance and took notes on their facilities. 
        We then had to create and present to a panel of judges a series of three 
        recomendations for the farm that could improve their overall operation, performance and efficiency.
